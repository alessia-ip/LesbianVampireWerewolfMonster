2:MC:You can talk?:Shocked
3:Librarian:All Jor≈çgumos can talk, child. We just don't fancy wasting our breath.:Tired 
4:MC:...:Serious
5:Librarian:Welcome to Her Royal Majesty's Private Atheneum. I am its protector...and its librarian.:Tired/Pleased 
6:MC:I could've killed you.:Serious

8:MC:You said I was late?:Serious
9:Librarian:I'm sorry?:Tired/Confused
10:MC:Just a second ago, you said that I was late. Late for what?:Serious
11:Librarian:Well, I've been waiting for your arrival. I've been tasked with delivering a message to you.:Tired
12:MC:A message?:Confused
13:Librarian:Yes, a message from The Lady of the Castle. Curious?:Tired
14:MC:Very.:Serious
15:Librarian:Do me a favor then: Bring me that erotic poetry book you were reading earlier.:Tired

19:MC:Here you go.:Serious
20:Librarian:You have my thanks.:Tired/Pleased
21:MC:It's incomplete. Just a bunch of blank pages after the first poems.:Serious
22:Librarian:So you admit that you were reading erotica in the Royal Library?:Tired/Silly
23:MC:...:Blank
24:Librarian:Ha! I jest, child. All of these texts belong to Her Royal Majesty. Her favorites, like Sapphic Summer, are scribed with magic.:Tired/Pleased
25:MC:You mean invisible ink? You're not serious.:Incredulous
26:Librarian:Oh, but I am. She was in here a little while ago reading from that very book. The ink hasn't completely worn away yet.:Tired
27:MC:Lucky me.:Sarcastic
28:Librarian:Truly. It's not often that a stranger is invited into the Royal Palace at the behest of the High Lady. Feel free to cry tears of joy, child.:Tired/Pleased
29:MC:M-Maybe later...and what of that message?:Irritated
30:Librarian:Forgive my dawdling. I am to tell you this: "To PASS, you must play the game. Now, go and speak the PHRASE revealed in FLAME.":Tired 
31:MC:I'll have you know: I'm not very good at riddles.:Serious
32:Librarian:That seems like a serious detriment to your work.:Tired
33:MC:Not when you have a scholar as an assistant. I shouldn't have left her at the inn.:Serious

34:MC:Could you tell me the message again?:Serious
35:Librarian:Of course. "To PASS, you must play the game. Now, go and speak the PHRASE revealed in FLAME.":Tired
